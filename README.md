# Ensemble-Techniques-Diagnosing-Parkinson-s-disease
Built a model using random forests in order to diagnose Parkinson's disease in patients. Used voice recordings of patients as data in order to differentiate between patients with and without Parkinson's disease. Measured performance of models and determined the optimal number of trees in order to obtain the best result.  Skills and Tools : Random Forests, Decision Trees, Ensembles Learning

Parkinson’s Disease (PD)
It is a degenerative neurological disorder marked by decreased dopamine levels in the brain. 
It manifests itself through a deterioration of movement, including the presence of tremors and stiffness. 
There is commonly a marked effect on speech, including dysarthria (difficulty articulating sounds), hypophonia (lowered volume), and monotone (reduced pitch range). Additionally, cognitive impairments and changes in mood can occur, and risk of dementia is increased.

Traditional diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease involves a clinician taking a neurological history of the patient and observing motor skills in various situations. 
Since there is no definitive laboratory test to diagnose PD, diagnosis is often difficult, particularly in the early stages when motor effects are not yet severe. Monitoring progression of the disease over time requires repeated clinic visits by the patient. An effective screening process, particularly one that doesn’t require a clinic visit, would be beneficial. Since PD patients exhibit characteristic vocal features, voice recordings are a useful and non-invasive tool for diagnosis. If machine learning algorithms could be applied to a voice recording dataset to accurately diagnosis PD, this would be an effective screening step prior to an appointment with a clinician.

The data consists of those diagnosed with Parkinson Disease and those who do not.
